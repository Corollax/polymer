Polymer examples
=================

Each subfolder contains a specific example case.
They can be run by running `gopherjs build` inside the example sub directory.
Followed by running `caddy` in the examples/ directory itself and then pointing your browser at `http://localhost:2015/example_name/`
This ofcourse requires caddy and gopherjs.

GopherJS can be retrieved by running `go get github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs`
Caddy can be retrieved by running `go get github.com/mholt/caddy`
